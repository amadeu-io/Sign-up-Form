When a theme button is clicked, a black outer border appears to indicate that it's been selected. Initially I was using a normal CSS border for this, but the position of the rest of the elements would 
change slightly when one or other button was selected, since the size of the element would slightly increase and that would change the grid. The only way I could find around this problem is to use a shadow emulating a border, since the shadow, while being outside of the element, doesn't count on it's size. I'm sure there has to be a better solution, but for the moment I'm happy with this.

Why are template literals so awesome?
