When a theme button is clicked, a black outer border appears to indicate that it's been selected. 

When doing this, the position of the buttons won't change based on which one is selected. This is thanks to using a shadow emulating an outer border instead of a border, since the shadown does't add size, the grid children stay completely still. There's probably a better method to do this out there.

btw, why are template literals so awesome?
